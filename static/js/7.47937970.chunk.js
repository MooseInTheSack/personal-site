I know way too many people who just give up their hobbies and passions after graduating college. But voluntarily pursuing things that interest you molds your personality and builds several skills, many of which can improve your work performance.\n\n# Currently\n\nI'm currently finishing up my Full-Time MBA at Texas A&M University.\n\n# I like\n\n- Video Games (Rocket League)\n- Running\n- Pickup Basketball\n- Pickup Soccer\n- Playing the banjo (I still suck though)\n- [Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/141629135-tyler-kirkpatrick)\n- [Writing](https://medium.com/@tkirkpatrick404)\n- [Drawing](https://instagram.com/alliseeisbeans)\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I am from originally from Arkansas.\n- In 2012, I visited Hungary, Austria, The Czech Republic, and Germany.\n- In 2017, I spent the summer in the United Kingdom for a study-abroad program at Oxford University.\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- My little brother shot me in the eye with an airsoft gun in high school and I almost lost complete vision in that eye, but it miraculously recovered to better than 20/20 vision.\n\n# I dream of\n\n- Always learning new things.\n- Getting better every day.\n- One day having a nice plot of land with a garden.\n\n# Websites from people I admire\n\n- [Michael D'Angelo](https://mldangelo.com/) (I stole- borrowed this guy's website template)\n- [Henry Ruiz](https://haruiz.github.io/en/about/)\n- [Luke Wood](https://lukewood.xyz/about)",h=u.split(/\s+/).map((function(n){return n.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(n){return n.length})).length,c=function(n){var e=Object.assign({},n);return Object(i.jsx)(r.b,Object(a.a)({},e))};e.default=function(){return Object(i.jsx)(l.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Tyler Kirkpatrick",children:Object(i.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(i.jsx)("header",{children:Object(i.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(i.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(i.jsx)(r.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(i.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",h," words)"]})]})}),Object(i.jsx)(s.a,{source:u,renderers:{Link:c},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
