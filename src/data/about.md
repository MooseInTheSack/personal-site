# Travel / Geography

- I am from originally from Arkansas.
- I've been to ~ 6 countries, some of which I have forgotten, and many of which I would like to revisit.
- In 2012, I visited Hungary, Austria, The Czech Republic, and Germany.
- In 2017, I spent the summer in the United Kingdom for a study-abroad program at Oxford University.

# Fun facts

- My little brother shot me in the eye with an airsoft gun in high school and I almost lost complete vision in that eye, but it miraculously recovered to better than 20/20 vision.

# I dream of

- Always learning new things.
- Getting better every day.
- One day having a nice plot of land with a garden.
