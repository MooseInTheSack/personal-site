# Intro

Hello, I'm Tyler Kirkpatrick and I'm a Software Developer who likes to stay physically active with running and pickup basketball, and stay mentally active by learning new things and improving on what I already know.

I believe there's more to life than sitting at your desk until 5, blanking out in front of your TV until it's time for bed, and doing it all over again the next day.

That's why I love learning new things, and improving existing skills like drawing, writing, and playing the banjo. I know way too many people who just give up their hobbies and passions after graduating college. But voluntarily pursuing things that interest you molds your personality and builds several skills, many of which can improve your work performance.

# Fun facts

- My little brother shot me in the eye with an airsoft gun in high school and I almost lost complete vision in that eye, but it miraculously recovered to better than 20/20 vision.
